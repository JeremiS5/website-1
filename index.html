I chose this topic because I’m interested in it, and because I believe that playing video games can have substantial benefits. I also wanted to refute biases by providing information. I searched Google Scholar to find scientific studies related to my topic. I also watched several TED talks and read newspaper articles. <br><br>

                        <li>The genre of games they most often play is widely varied, but the most common is Role Playing game series such as The Elder Scrolls, Pokemon, Fallout and the Witcher.</li>
                        <li>The majority of them estimate that they play 11-20 hours of games per week.</li>
                        <li>There is an even split between the students that believe that playing games is beneficial to their brain, and those who don’t.</li>
                        <li>The majority of students play video games for fun, rather than to socialise or learn.</li>
                        <li>The majority of students believe that playing games causes them to receive worse marks at school.</li>
                        <li>All students who believed that playing games caused them to receive better marks at school also believe that playing games improves brain function.</li>
                        <li>The students that believed that playing games made their marks worse generally say that the time would be better spent studying, which they believe would result in better marks.</li>
                        <li>The majority of the students that believed that playing games made their marks worse believe that playing games improves brain function.</li>
                        <li>Almost all students believe that children can benefit by playing video games.</li>

                <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 bodypg">Playing video games is clearly highly beneficial to those of all ages and situations, as long as the person playing has the self control not to play games so much that it interferes with their quality of life, meaning that it interrupts healthy sleep cycles or causes less work or education to be done, or causes them to withdraw socially.<br><br>
                My hypothesis is accurate and correct. There is substantial evidence from my research that playing games directly leads to improved mental functioning.<br><br>
                Some of my constraints were accurate. I did not have enough time to make a website that was up to my standards. I found enough data to provide a suitable amount of findings.
